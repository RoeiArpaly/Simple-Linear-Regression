The Simple Mathematics Behind the Simple Linear Regression

The Simple Linear Regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable (independent variable) that explains the dependent variable.
Based on the points of x,y in the dimension, the model creates a linear line that passes between the points with the minimum aggregated distance.
